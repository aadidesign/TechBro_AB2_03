Enhancing Clinical Decision Support Systems with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Model
Problem Statement (PS 3)
Enhancing Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Model
Hackathon Track: Healthcare AI & Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS)

Problem Description
Healthcare professionals face challenges in accessing accurate, real-time, and relevant medical information for clinical decision-making. Traditional Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) rely on static databases and predefined rules, limiting their adaptability to evolving medical research and guidelines.

Key Challenges:
Outdated Knowledge: CDSS lacks real-time integration with new medical research.
Limited Context Awareness: Struggles to retrieve patient-specific insights from structured & unstructured data.
Slow & Inefficient Decision-Making: Doctors manually sift through vast medical literature.
Our Solution
We propose an AI-powered CDSS that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance clinical decision support.

Key Features:
✅ Real-Time Medical Knowledge Retrieval: Fetches latest research from PubMed, WHO, FDA.
✅ AI-Powered Clinical Recommendations: Uses fine-tuned GPT-4/BioBERT for context-aware insights.
✅ Seamless Integration with EHRs: Combines structured patient data with medical literature.
✅ Explainable AI (XAI): Confidence scores & transparent decision-making.
✅ Secure & Scalable: HIPAA & GDPR-compliant deployment in cloud environments.

How It Works
1️⃣ Doctor inputs a medical query (e.g., best treatment for pneumonia).
2️⃣ Retrieval System fetches relevant research using BM25, Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR).
3️⃣ AI Model (GPT-4/BioBERT) processes & summarizes findings into actionable recommendations.
4️⃣ Doctor reviews AI-generated insights, validates, and makes decisions.

Technical Architecture
Data Collection & Processing
🔹 Extracts structured patient data from Electronic Health Records (EHRs).
🔹 Retrieves unstructured data from medical research repositories (PubMed, WHO, ClinicalTrials.gov).
🔹 Stores data efficiently using vector databases (FAISS, Pinecone).

AI-Powered Clinical Decision Support
🔹 Retrieval Models: Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) & BM25 for medical document search.
🔹 Generative AI: GPT-4, BioBERT, or LLaMA fine-tuned for clinical data.
🔹 Named Entity Recognition (NER): Extracts medical conditions, drugs, and treatment options.

Hospital Integration & Security
🔹 FHIR API Integration: Enables seamless EHR connectivity.
🔹 Secure Cloud Deployment: AWS/Azure/GCP hosting.
🔹 HIPAA & GDPR Compliance: Ensures patient data privacy & encryption.
